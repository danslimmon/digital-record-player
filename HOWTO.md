# How to build a Digital Record Player

This file is a walkthrough of the process of converting a record player into a Digital Record Player.

### Equipment

You will need:

* **A record player**. The simpler the better. All it really needs is a working turntable – don't even worry if it can't produce sound.
* **A Raspberry Pi** and associated trappings (MicroSD card and power cable). A high-quality digital copy of a full-length album is roughly 100 MB – make sure your MicroSD card is big enough to hold as many albums as you want to load onto the device.
